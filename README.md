# Face_Recognition
This is an elementary facial recognition project which I made for our Software Engineering Project using the OpenCV library in Python. 
I used Haar Cascades for our project.

Our project “Facial Recognition System” is an improved small scale model of the facial recognition systems used in our day-to-day lives. Facial recognition has become an essential aspect in various fields as it provides maximum accuracy,security and convenience while using it. However, this technology is very expensive and difficult to access for the masses due to the high cost of equipment involved.We plan to provide a solution to this problem through our
project.  Our system only needs a CCTV camera or a normal High Resolution Camera which can click good images. The system detects the
person from the video/image using the training which it has gained from the dataset training done earlier. It then identifies it from the database we have created earlier and gives the name of the person(s) who has/have walked into the frame with high accuracy.
